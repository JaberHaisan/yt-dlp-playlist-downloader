My own custom script for downloading youtube playlists.

Enter the videos you want downloaded like list slicing in python (for e.g 1:20:2 downloads every
2nd video up to the 20th video, just : downloads every video).

Current options:
1) Downloads english subtitles if available.
2) Does not download live chats.
3) Converts files to mp4 if the video is in a different format.
4) Does not stop downloading videos due to errors (for e.g. a common error is when
youtube removes a video from their platform yet doesn't remove it from the playlist).
5) Keeps a download archive in the defined directory.
